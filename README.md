A1. Load the data into Hadoop, and perform a count of the records. List the steps you took to get the data in and to make the count.

A2. Execute a query to find per advertiser and hotel the cheapest price that was offered. Provide the query, and the result you got.

A3. For each search generate a list containing the cheapest price per hotel that offers breakfast. Again, please provide the query you used and the result.

A4. Generate the list from "task 3" with more efficiency (think about UDFs!). Provide all resources to understand your solution, and measure the difference in execution times.
